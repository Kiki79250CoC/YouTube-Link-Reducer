# YouTube-Link-Reducer
YouTube Link Reducer is the first and an old project I made when I begun coding with Visual Basic .NET in fall-2014. This very tiny app is based on .NET Framework 2.0, and this is basically a very simple and stupid piece of code who replace the "long" YouTube URL format (`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=`) by the "short" format (`https://youtube.be/`).

It is also the only source code from this period that I have managed to keep over the years, the others were lost when the hard drive of my 2 previous PCs stopped working, one in 2016 and the other in 2018.

All code has been updated in 2021 with my new way of managing and cleaning code. I also added some comments because I never comments on my code before. And finally I translated all assets from French to English, which is a more global language than French.

# Source code maintenance - Information
It's not planned at all that I will maintain this code later. I just made a few tweaks in the source code almost 7 years after just to put it on this repo. You can fork it and make your own version, of course, but don't hope that I create a new version of this program in the future. The version 1.08 will normally be the last version.
